    <string name="app_name">Simon</string>
    <string name="aboutTextView">Simon was created by Ralph Baer who also developed the first video game console “The Brown Box” in 1967. Simon was first released in 1978 and was heavily inspired by the Atari arcade game “Touch Me”. This game had four buttons with each button having a different colour and playing a diffternt note. Baer thought he could improve upon this arcade game as the sound the buttons made did not make a tune when played in sequence. The notes the original Simon made are in the key of A major with blue being E, yellow being C#, red being A and green being the E an octave lower than blue, these are the same notes that a bugle can make."</string>
